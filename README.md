# Grid-Navigation-Robot-Agent
Design and implement an agent that navigates a 4x4 grid world. The agent starts at a random location, and its goal is to reach a fixed destination. Along the way, the agent must be able to sense obstacles which are randomly placed on the grid and make decisions to avoid them.
